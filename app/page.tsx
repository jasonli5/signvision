            We developed a software to teach people how to use sign language
            with the help of AI primarily for people struggling to learn. Those
            who are deaf, or are unable to speak may only communicate with
            others through written notes, which often felt limiting and
            impersonal. Motivated by our desire to engage more deeply and
            effectively with them, we created this tool to make learning sign
            language accessible and engaging for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to encourage people who donâ€™t have the tools to learn
            sign language to learn through our creation, our website.
            Accomplishing this goal means that sign language will not be as rare
            as it is today, and communicating with deaf people will be much
            easier and common. Our mission is to bridge the communication gap
            and foster more inclusive interactions.
